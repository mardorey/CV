  <strong><a href="http://www.kintecglobal.com">Kintec Recruitment</a> - April 2008 - March 2018</strong>
  <p>
    <strong>Resourcer to Business Manager</strong>
    </center>
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout my 10 years’ at Kintec, I have developed my experience through the company Organic Growth model, beginning my career as a Resourcer then progressing further to a Business Manager. This role saw me running the recruitment function across various Countries and Continents for some of the world’s leading companies. My roles have led me to working successfully with individuals from Graduates and entry level candidates right through to Managing Directors, Engineering Managers and HR Directors/Business Partners.
<br />
<br />
    I have led teams of recruiters, ranging from Trainee Consultants through to Senior Recruitment Consultants and have trained people within the sector in terms of the recruitment process, business development, time and database management.
<br />

    I have worked with companies across the globe, having managed divisions in the UK, Europe, Africa and South East Asia, and have travelled across continents to develop new business and maintain existing relationships.
  </p>

<h4><strong>2015 – 2018 			Business Manager – UK Contract</strong></h4>
<p>
  In September 2015 I transferred over to the UK Recruitment Business, encompassing a large number of Oil and Gas clients in the UK. The position involved being proactive, with the requirement to lead by example. I travelled across the country to maintain the current client base and develop existing relationships through providing expert advice and offering ad hoc benchmarking support upon request. The position also involved managing the tender process for new clients, including researching opportunities to seek new business and using my experience and knowledge to win business through some very competitive tender exercises.
</p>

<h4><strong>2013 – 2015			Business Manager – UK, Africa & Far East Asia</strong></h4>
<p>
  In October 2013 I was promoted to Business Manager of the International Division of Kintec, where I managed 3 Senior Consultants in a division spanning mainland Europe, Africa and Asia. I travelled throughout Europe and South East Asia to meet with clients of all types and seniorities in order to create and maintain relationships. The role was in a fast paced environment, competing against companies all over the world. In this role I developed skills as a people manager and in negotiating with clients across many varying cultures.
</p>

<h4><strong>2010 - 2013		Recruitment Consultant/Senior Recruitment Consultant</strong></h4>
<p>
  In 2010, I transferred to the UK Contract Oil and Gas Division. In this role, I continued the work I had started as a Resourcer within this new section, before progressing and further and running the Process Engineering, Safety Engineer and Subsea Engineering subsections. I trebled the size of these sections within a couple of years and by 2013 was running a team of 2 Senior Consultants and 2 Consultants. My duties remained very similar, starting with business through cold calls and then developing these relationships into repeat business. Within my period in the UK Contract division, I set records in placements and calls despite working through period blighted by a recession.
</p>

  <h4><strong>2009  Recruitment Consultant</strong></h4>

<p>
  In 2009, I joined a team recruiting in the Petrochemical and Pharmaceutical industries where again I was speaking to candidates suitable for positions, organising interviews and placing them in the relevant roles with the relevant companies. During this time I continued to develop my knowledge within these industries. This involved using the database, the internet and once again developing leads.
</p>

<h4><strong>2008				Resourcer/Recruitment Consultant</strong></h4>
<p>
  When I began at Kintec I started as a Resourcer. During this period, I was given vacancies to fill utilising a database of over 22,000 candidates, searching for relevant candidates, discussing with them the rates, roles and locations of jobs. This was followed by arranging interviews and placing candidates within oil and gas companies.
<br /><br />
  Within a month I was promoted to consultant level where I moved to a head hunting team for 7 months. This team specialised in the recruitment of Geoscientists within the Oil and Gas industry. Key tasks included; cold calling candidates for roles based around the globe, as well as developing business, by liaising with both clients and candidates, and developing and pursuing leads provided by contacts.
<br /><br />
  Kintec we were a small recruitment firm in Manchester with 12 members of staff in 2008. By 2018, Kintec are now a Global Oil and Gas specialist recruitment team, with access to well over 150,000 engineers globally, who were the fastest growing technical recruitment agency in the UK in 2013.
